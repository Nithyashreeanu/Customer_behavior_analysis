# Customer Behavior Analysis – Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior using an end-to-end data analytics workflow. The objective is to convert raw data into meaningful business insights through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, and dashboard visualization.

The project demonstrates practical experience with Python, PostgreSQL, SQL, and Power BI, covering the complete data analytics lifecycle.

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer shopping behavior information, including:
- Customer demographics
- Product categories
- Purchase amount
- Subscription status
- Review ratings
- Purchase frequency

The dataset was loaded and processed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- PostgreSQL
- SQLAlchemy
- SQL
- Power BI

## Data Analysis and Processing
The following steps were performed:
- Loaded the dataset using Python
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data by handling missing values and removing redundant columns
- Stored the cleaned data in a PostgreSQL database
- Executed SQL queries to analyze customer behavior

## Power BI Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize key insights, including:
- Total number of customers
- Average purchase amount
- Average review rating
- Revenue and sales by product category
- Customer subscription status distribution

The dashboard provides a clear and business-focused view of customer purchasing patterns.

## Results and Key Insights
- Identified top-performing product categories
- Analyzed customer subscription trends
- Evaluated customer satisfaction using review ratings
- Generated insights useful for business decision-making
